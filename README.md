Uncertainty for Critical Loads

### Motivation
Lichen-based critical loads (CLs) are threshold deposition levels at which ecological harm is averted.  CLs (which are absolute values) must be accompanied by uncertainty estimates to avoid a false sense of precision.  Here, we quantify and map uncertainty in lichen-based CLs and exceedances for nitrogen and sulfur based on 9,000+ systematic, whole-community lichen surveys across the United States.
